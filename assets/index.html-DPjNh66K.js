Even if the past events contain 90% heads and 10% tails, this does not mean that the future events will contain more tails to &quot;correct&quot; past unevenness.

Setting profit target in each time interval (by month, season or year) can be detrimental in a market with momentum. If the profit in the time interval is meet, stop investing misses large profit from trend. If the profit in the time interval is not meet near the end, then the trader tend to be more nervous and more aggressive, which is dangerous.</p><p>However, setting stop-loss in each time interval has be good effects.

It&#39;s also related to binary thinking: thinking that an risk is either completely eliminated or not being taken any action on. The rational decision is to do a tradeoff to reduce overall risk.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>Choose to pay off a small debt completely, rather than paying off high-interest-rate debt first, as eliminating one debt feels more satisfying and reduces memory pressure.</li><li>Enforcing extreme lockdown to eliminate the risk of a pandemic, causing more risk in other diseases (because hospitals are locked down) and more risk in basic living (food supply is constrainted due to extreme lockdown).</li><li>Wanting to hedge inflation by heavily investing in risky assets, whose risk can be higher than inflation.

The &quot;querying capacity&quot; of brain is limited and can be occupied by distracting things.</p><p>(Side note: the similar principle also applies to computer databases.

Joe Phenomena: Understanding the Limits of Metacognitive Awareness on Debiasing](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication Files/21-084_436ebba8-c832-4922-bb6e-49d000a77df3.pdf)</p><h2 id="two-trading-strategies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#two-trading-strategies"><span>Two trading strategies</span></a></h2><p>Consider two financial trading strategies:</p><ul><li>Strategy 1 has small gains frequently but has huge loss rarely (suffering from negative Black Swan events).</li><li>Strategy 2 has small losses frequently but has rare huge gains (utilizing positive Black Swan events).</li></ul><p>In the long term, strategy 2 can greatly outperforms strategy 1, but people prefer strategy 1, because of many reasons:</p><ul><li>Convex perception. Frequent small gains feels better than a rare huge gain, and frequent small losses feels worse than a rare huge loss.</li><li>Loss aversion. The loss aversion focused more on recent visible loss rather than potential rare large loss.</li><li>Availability bias and outcome bias. The frequent small losses are more visible than rare potential big loss.</li><li>Delayed feedback issue. The rare loss in strategy 1 usually come late.</li><li>Oddball effect. The time experiencing loss and risk feels longer.</li><li>...</li></ul><p>It&#39;s a common misconception that a you need a win rate more than 50% to be profitable. With a favorable odds, profit is possible despite a low win rate. The skew of profit distribution is important.</p><p>Disposition effect:</p><ul><li>Investors tend to sell the asset that increased in value (make uncertain profit certain).</li><li>Investors tend to not sell the asset that dropped in value, hoping them to rebound (prefer having hope instead of making loss certain). What&#39;s more, increasing position can amortize the loss rate, which creates an illusion that loss reduces.</li></ul><p>Disposition effect works well in oscillating markets. However, markets can also exhibit momentum, where disposition effect is detrimental.</p>',438)]))}const g=t(p,[["render",c],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/article/cognitive-biases/","title":"Notes about Cognitive Biases","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"readingTime":false,"lastUpdated":false,"outline":"deep","prev":false,"next":false,"backToTop":false,"createTime":"2025/02/22 12:31:52","permalink":"/article/cognitive-biases/","title":"Notes about Cognitive Biases","description":"A summarization of the main cognitive biases, relating to financial trading, combined with my own understanding.
